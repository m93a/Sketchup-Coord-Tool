Description:
This extension is capable of transforming the model (or more precisely
the active selection) from the Cartesian coordinates into cylindrical
or spherical coordinates and maping them back to X, Y and Z. This way
you can eg. create spiral staircase using just the push/pull tool.

Usage:
/* TODO */
Access the extension from the menu "Plugins > Extension Warehouse Template".
Developers are encouraged to use this script to learn the basics of how to
create an extension that is compatible with the Extension Warehouse.
